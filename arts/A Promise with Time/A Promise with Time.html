        <h5>Synopsis</h5>
        <p>Bai Suzhen and Xu Xian met at a public health lecture. Their shared interest in traditional medicine 
            drew close, and Xu Xian gradually discovered Bai Suzhen's unique healing philosophies. These insights 
            not only inspired his family's Chinese medicine store but also prompted him to rethink his family's 
            financial struggles. However, as time passed, Xu Xian gradually discovered that Bai Suzhen's medical 
            skills seemed to possess unexplained miraculous effects, filling him with doubts and raising questions 
            about her true identity.
            <br>在一次公益健康講座上，白素貞與許仙相識。兩人因為對傳統醫學的共同興趣走得很近，許仙在與她交流中逐漸發現了白素貞獨特的治療理念，這些理念不僅為許仙的家族中藥店注入了新鮮的靈感，也讓他開始重新思考家族的經營困境。然而，隨著時間的推移，許仙逐漸發現白素貞的醫術中似乎存在著難以解釋的神奇效果，這讓他內心充滿了疑慮，開始對她的真實身份產生了懷疑。</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>At this point, lawyer Fa Hai intervened. He claimed that Bai Suzhen's actions might involve fraud and 
            demanded an investigation. Fahai's intervention further complicates matters. Bai Suzhen's past and the 
            mysterious nature of her medical skills become the source of his doubts, and Xu Xian struggles with 
            the pressures of both sides, unsure whether to continue trusting the woman who has captured his heart.
            <br>就在此時，律師法海介入了這一事件。他聲稱白素貞的行為可能涉嫌欺詐，要求展開調查。法海的介入讓事情變得更加複雜，白素貞的過去和醫術的神秘性成為了他質疑的根源，而許仙也在兩者之間的壓力下陷入了掙扎，無法確定自己是否該繼續相信這位讓他心動的女性。</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>To protect Bai Suzhen's secret, Xiaoqing steps forward and confronts Fahai head-on. This action puts Xu 
            Xian under pressure from both sides, forcing him into an unprecedented struggle between his love and 
            trust for Bai Suzhen and his unease at Fahai's doubts.
            <br>為了保護白素貞的秘密，小青決定挺身而出，與法海展開了正面的對抗。這一行動讓許仙感受到雙方的壓力，他的內心更是陷入了前所未有的掙扎，既有對白素貞的愛與信任，也有對法海提出的質疑感到不安。</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>As the story progresses and reaches its climax, Bai Suzhen's secret is finally revealed. She is the soul 
            of a man who, driven by love thousands of years ago, has returned to the human world with an unfinished 
            mission to atone for humanity's sins. This revelation shocks Xu Xian, but he ultimately sides with Bai 
            Suzhen and openly confronts Fahai's doubts. Bai Suzhen bravely admits her past, an act that not only 
            brings her inner peace but also strengthens her bond with Xu Xian.
            <br>隨著故事進展，高潮來臨，白素貞的秘密終於被揭開。原來，她正是千年前因愛而犯錯的靈魂，帶著未完成的使命重返人間，為人類贖罪。這一發現令許仙震驚，但他最終選擇站在白素貞一邊，並公開面對法海的質疑。白素貞也勇敢地承認了自己的過去，這一舉動不僅讓她的內心得到解脫，也讓她和許仙之間的關係更加堅固。</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Bai Suzhen's medical methods are recognized, and she and Xu Xian find a balance in real life 
            and begin a new life together. After this confrontation, Fahai re-examined his sense of justice and 
            embraced the gray areas of human nature with a more tolerant attitude. He no longer categorized things 
            as black and white, but began to understand that everyone has their own challenges and pasts. Xiaoqing, 
            meanwhile, discovered her own dreams through this incident, fulfilling her pursuit of freedom and art.
            <br>最終，白素貞的醫療方法得到認可，她與許仙在現實生活中找到了平衡，開始了新的生活。法海經歷了這場對抗後，重新審視了自己的正義觀，並選擇以更加寬容的心態來看待人性中的灰色地帶。他不再單純地將事物分為黑白，而是開始理解到每個人都有自己的難處與過去。而小青也在這場事件中找到了屬於自己的夢想，實現了她對自由與藝術的追求。</p>

            deep remorse for past mistakes and lives to atone for past grudges. She can heal both the heart and 
            the body while concealing a secret (actually a reincarnation of a soul from a thousand years ago).

            He has a gentle but somewhat cowardly personality. He is kind-hearted and deeply attached to Bai Suzhen,

            <br>法海：律師，專注於揭露偽善與違法行為，對白素貞抱持深深的懷疑與敵意。正義感很強，但是缺乏柔軟，認為凡事都應該有「規矩」。想要揭露白素貞的秘密，阻止她「誤導」許仙，但在追逐真相的過程中逐漸反思自己的信念。</p>
